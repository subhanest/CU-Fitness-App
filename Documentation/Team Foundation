Common Vision

Team Name: SoftGrid

The name SoftGrid reflects the team's commitment to creating interconnected, robust, and efficient software solutions. Just like a grid forms a stable foundation for power or data networks, SoftGrid represents the seamless integration of creativity, collaboration, and technology to deliver cutting-edge software products.


Slogan: "We Connect Ideas to Innovation."

This slogan highlights the team's goal of transforming concepts into impactful, user-friendly software solutions. It reflects the core values of collaboration, efficiency, and innovation in software development.








SoftGrid Rules and Commitments


1. Behavioral Norms

Meeting Attendance: All team members must attend scheduled meetings unless prior notice is given. Meetings will start on time, and any lateness beyond 5 minutes will require a notification to the team.

Deadlines: Individual tasks will be completed at least 24 hours before the team’s deadline to ensure time for review and feedback. Missed deadlines will be addressed promptly, and support will be provided if required.

Work Division: Tasks will be divided based on each member’s skills and interests, ensuring a balanced and efficient workflow. Each team member is responsible for completing their assigned tasks on time and maintaining quality throughout.

Work Quality: All deliverables must meet team standards, proper documentation, clear coding practices, and full alignment with the project requirements.


2. Rule Enforcement

The Team Lead will be responsible for enforcing the rules and ensuring that all members are held accountable. It will also act as a point of contact for any issues or delays that arise within the team.


3. Quality Assurance

Peer Reviews will be conducted, where each member reviews another team member’s work to ensure high-quality standards are met. For instance, Member A will check Member B’s work, Member B will check Member C’s work, and so on. All deliverables will be tested functionally, ensuring they align with project requirements and are error-free.


4. Conflict Resolution


Conflicts may arise from:

Disputes over task ownership.
Differing opinions on implementation approaches.
Unequal distribution of workload.
Conflict Mediation

In case of conflict, the involved members will discuss the issue calmly during a meeting. If the conflict remains unresolved, the Team Lead will mediate and facilitate a solution. For more serious conflicts that hinder progress, we will escalate the issue to the TA or professor.


5. Communication Protocol

Regular Check-Ins will be scheduled weekly to discuss updates and any issues. Open Communication is encouraged, and team members are free to voice concerns during meetings or privately with the Team Lead.

Issue escalation: Minor concerns will be addressed within the team. Critical issues that impede progress will be escalated to the TA or professor.


6. Handling Non-Performance

If a team member is not fulfilling their responsibilities, the following actions will be taken:

1. The Team Lead will have a private conversation with the member to understand the issue.
2. The team will offer support or reassign tasks if necessary to ensure progress.
3. If non-performance continues, the issue will be escalated to the TA or professor.

Commitment Summary

Each member of SoftGrid commits to punctuality, task ownership, quality work, and respectful communication throughout the project. These rules may be adjusted as needed to maintain efficiency, harmony, and productivity.


We believe, all these ensures SoftGrid operates effectively, with a strong focus on collaboration and accountability.
